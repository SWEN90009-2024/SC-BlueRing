Meeting notes: Hao Guan


1. Since Ruby is currently limited to the University of Melbourne-related research or partners, are we doing our project based on university data & environment or is it more wide-ranged.


* Focusing on University data since it is used in the University of Melbourne


2. What are the deliverables of this project? What are some of the expectations?


* The deliverables are part of our task instruction and the client doesn't have that so they can't tell us.
* The difference between a good solution and a not so practical solution is that we don't increase teachers' workload. Our client doesn't want to increase teacher workload?
* Possible solution provided by client: “So a very easy solution would be to make the teachers do more, you know, enter more data, you know, design something or you know, but another part of this problem is that the teachers don't want to do anything that's adding on to their workload.”
* The current technology and ethical considerations about classrooms can be considered.(criteria)


3. We have been provided with some instructions and explanations about how Ruby measures complex competencies and help generate reports, but will there be some real case studies or samples provided to us later so we can have a better understanding of the project objectives. 


* Ruby demo shown in the meeting.


4. As we are trying to find how teachers make judgments on students’ learning, is it possible for us to gather information by scheduling interviews or sending out surveys to teachers & tutors we know, while listing out this research is for Ruby?


* We need to discuss this with our mentor.


5. Are there some criteria for teachers to mark students provided?


* The challenges teachers face in assessing student performance and the desire for a more efficient way to collect accurate information. They mentioned wishing for a camera-like technology that could collect classroom information and provide detailed records, but such a solution has not yet been implemented. Therefore, they argue that an approach that falls somewhere between existing technologies and ideal solutions is needed, balancing current technical and ethical considerations to provide a more accurate understanding of classroom situations.


Problem that client met:


* They just have a research problem that they don't know how teachers are answering those questions(in Ruby).
* Too much workload for teachers.




What next?


* Brain storm the possible solutions
* Roles and responsibilities
* Sprint1 due at this Friday 17:00
