## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By

- Jianqiao Song

### **Before the meeting begins**

1. Mentor and Hao determine the start time for weekly meetings
2. Mentor and Hao determine how to contact the client
    - Can be sent to client through mentor
    - This agenda can be sent directly to Richard, cc: mentor

### **Possible solution 1**

1. Mingchong introduced the idea of subteam 2
    - Problems with the ruby platform
        1. In the current ruby platform, teachers have to submit an evaluation form for each student, which brings a large workload to teachers.
        2. The evaluation form only provides teachers with single-choice choices in text form. The form is boring, and the workload is heavy.
        3. Simply describing the options in words may cause ambiguity in understanding.
    - Solutions
        1. Visualize the options and attach examples to help teachers better understand and increase speed and accuracy.
        2. Slider form
        3. Pick and group format, matrix table format: It is convenient for teachers to make horizontal comparisons between students and complete the assessment of all students on the same topic at one time
2. Aoxiang and the mentor confirm preferred and feasible solutions, while Hao provides additional explanations on subteam 2’s ideas
3. Mentor’s ideas and suggestions
    - We can use AI tools such as Midjourney to help with visualization and generate images that are highly relevant to the options.
    - Mentor prefers visual solutions and matrix table solutions
    - Mentor agrees that our ideas can be used in the design of sprint3

### **Possible solution 2**

1. Hao introduces the idea of subteam 1 and Aoxiang provides additional explanations
    
    Solve the problem of possible deviations between teachers in assessing students’ comprehensive abilities
    
    - Solution to assign weight coefficients to each evaluation direction
    - When teachers join the Ruby platform, ask them to fill in a questionnaire about the importance of various assessment directions to obtain each teacher's preference coefficient for different directions.
    - When teachers evaluate students, their scores for each direction will be multiplied by the preference coefficients they provide to obtain a weighted score.
    - The system will aggregate the weighted scores of multiple teachers and calculate the average as the final evaluation result of the student to reduce the impact of personal bias.
    - Teachers can update their preference coefficients once per semester or year.
    - Before the formal assessment, the system will first calculate the average weight coefficient in each direction and then allow the teacher to start the assessment.
    - When evaluating, teachers need to describe their interactions with the student to demonstrate their understanding of the student.
    - For students with different professional intentions, higher weight can be given to the scores in the corresponding direction in the final report.
2. Mentor’s ideas and suggestions
- Mentor recommends to present the solution in the form of a flow chart by using Figma so that customers can better understand it.
- For low-fidelity prototypes, it is recommended to use a hand-drawn effect and annotate the function of each interface element.
- Overall, the proposed ideas and suggestions are recognized, and there is a need to continue improving the details
