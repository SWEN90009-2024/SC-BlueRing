## Discussion Points

1. **Notes and structure of the Final presentation**
    - The duration of the final presentation is 12 minutes, and it is not necessary for everyone to do the presentation; 3-4 people are sufficient.
    - It is recommended to use Canva, Figma or PowerPoint to design the slides.
    - Don't add too much text and long paragraphs, we can use AI tools to generate some relevant images, each slide can take 1-2 minutes.
    - Describe a scenario, tell a short story to illustrate a problem, then propose a solution and reflect on the successes and challenges of the project.
    - Everyone in the team should be familiar with the project in order to be prepared for the Q&A session.
    - Possible structure: Introduction of our team members, mentor and clients, background of the project, overview of the project, user stories, usability test, etc. (for the exact structure we can look at the requirements on the LMS)
2. **Project progress and Q&A sessions**
    - Is there still a client meeting coming up next?
        
        We can still have one last client meeting before the project handover.
        
    - Should we submit a user journey?
        
        Yes.
        
    - Is the data sample a database? (like .sqlite3/ .csv file) or just show data on prototypes?
        
        Depends on ourselves.
        
3. **Stand up meeting**
    - With the mentor watching, everyone in the group held a stand up meeting.
    - Everyone shared their recent work, todayâ€™s work and future plans.
