### Feedbacks - 26 March Meeting
1.Sharing of project detail information.
2. A periodic(can be weekly) mentor meeting should be scheduled with a time agreed upon all team memebr and mentor's availability, server as a stand-up meeting. The current scheduled time is 5-6pm every Tuesday, may subject to change.
3. Product owner need to share the file sent by mentor with all team members.
4. We should not try to contact the client by ourselves, communication between client and the team should be done though mentor to schedule client meetings.

## Feedbacks - 9 April Meeting
1. Personas should be changed to make them more presentable, the current persona is too wordy, and it's hard for reader to see the important points by the first look. Adding more charts or graphs will be a good approach to make the persona more presentable.
2. The attendance of the weekly meeting is not ideal, since this is a stand-up meeting which mentor need to record, all team members should try to attand the meeting, need to allocate a different time if most teammates find it hard to attend the current meeting time schedule.
3. All documents in each sprints should be living documents, no need for folder such as Sprint1 or Sprint2 folders.
4. The responsibilities and roles need to be documented in a clearer way.
5. Mentor will try to get team the access to RUBY, and will contact the develop team to ask for a test version of the platform for team research purpose.
