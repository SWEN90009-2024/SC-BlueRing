## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By
- Haocheng Wang

### Discussion Points

1. **Comments on project Sprint1 assignment**
    - Need to make documentations more clear, for example: responsbilities, roles, weekly meetings, etc. Mentor had also mentioned that we should change the way we upload document (need further clarification from mentor about that).
    - Team will receive a detailed feedback later.

2. **Possible project solution suggested by Mentor**
    - While designing the system for teachers to make judgments on students' performance and generating reports, those reports and comments of  teachers
    should be accessible to other teachers to provide valuable insights and different perspectives.
    - Those reports and comments from other teachers should not be visible to students.

3. **Improvement of the personas**
    - The current personas are too wordy and too dry to read. Those important pieces of information are not obvious to see for the readers.
    - Personas should be more presentable, the use of graphs or charts can highlight the important points and make personas more attractive.

4. **Stand-up Meeting**
    - The mentor has pointed out that our weekly meeting is a Stand-up meeting, all team memebers should attend and report on their progress of the previous week along with the quesitons they want to ask.
    - The attendance is important because the mentor need to record and run the meetings.
    - For the future meeting, the meeting start time will be 17:45pm on Tuesday (May subject to change).

5. **Communication with the client**
    - Since our client is currently unavailable and will be back after 15/04, we might not be able to have our client in zoom meeting untill then.
    - We can still contact the client by sending request to mentor via email. 

6. **Ruby Platform**
    - The accessibility of the Ruby Platform is still in progress, the mentor has contacted the develop team for a test version of Ruby for our project.
    - More detailed information about Ruby will be send out later to help team work on the project.

### Upcoming events for the following week
- Edit the existing personas based on the suggestions
- Figuring out the documentation problem we have in Sprint1 and prepare for future Sprints
- Start working on the user story
- Finalise the weekly meeting schedule and settings
