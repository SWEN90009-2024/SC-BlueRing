## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By
- Tori Li

### Discussion Points

1. **Client Meeting Feedback**
    -Reduce workloads, have a higher completion rates on surveys
    -The client seemed confused about the topic of mouse hover interactions that we discussed, indicating a need for clearer examples or visuals.
    -Proposal to recalculate scores based on weighted coefficients from attended classes.
    -Suggestions for enhancing survey style, including the use of examples, standards, and alternative question formats like sliders and multiple-choice.

2. **Discussion Points**
    -Inability to modify questions necessitates focus on teacher grading and avoiding self-peer evaluations.
    -Emphasis on teacher-written evaluations, accounting for diverse courses and metrics per student.

3. **Revised Direction**
    - Shift towards analyzing ability for broader insights, coporate with ATART to impacting college admissions.
    - Consider GAT, proposal to introduce similar non-academic metrics to increase evaluation accuracy.
    - Suggestions for prototype and possible solutions, including teacher-weighted questionnaires and interactive visualization tools.

4. **Action Items**
    - Develop a new survey to rank general abilities and preferences before actual survey
    - Implement coefficient adjustments based on teacher preferences.
        - i.e After each of the five teachers has individually assessed a student, the evaluation process will proceed following collective re-evaluation by all five teachers together.
        - OR we can adapated the method to calculate i.e (R1+...+R5) / 5 
    - Enhance platform usability through interface improvements
        1. Font Size (Font size need to be big)
        2. Interface Clarity (Users may experience confusion regarding how to create a student upon initiating the application).
        3. Auto adjust, capable on mutiple platform(phone, tablet, laptop)
        4. Adjust the word use in multiple choice, such as natural, heavy.
    - Consider increaseing sample sizes and teacher involvement to enhance accuracy
    - Establish consensus on result weighting and discussion processes among teachers.


### Next Steps
- Group 1: Define the criteria for coefficient determination and establish methods for weighing the general abilities of each student.
- Group 2: Re-design the user interface for improved usability and clarity.
