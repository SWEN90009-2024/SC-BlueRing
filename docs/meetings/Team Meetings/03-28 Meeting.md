## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By
- Yutian Fan and Hao Guan

### Discussion Points

1. **Standup questions**
    - We need to request an account from the client for understanding the Ruby system.
    - We need to confirm the system's algorithms and whether we need to make improvements to the existed system with Client.

2. **Come up with possible solutions**
    -*To address issues of subjectivity or and lack of standardization in teachers' grading:*
    - Hovering the mouse over an option for several seconds will display specific standards or criteria for that option, such as quantifiable or observable data like images, number of times spoken, etc.
    - Rank students based on the grades assigned by each teacher to all students, and then reassign grades accordingly.
    - Establish student self-assessment (not through direct questioning, but by setting up game scenarios to assign scores based on students' choices), which is then weighted with the teachers' grades for calculation.
      
3. **Come up with possible solutions**
    -*To solve the problem of variability in grading due to different subjects or different teachers' perceptions:*
    - Set weighted coefficients for questions: This could be provided by teachers or derived from statistical data (for example, if we find that among Teacher A's students, those who score high on question 1 tend to have higher overall scores, we can assume that this teacher places particular emphasis on the ability reflected by question 1, and we could then choose to increase or decrease the weighted coefficient for this question).
    -  Use a more rational pie chart to comprehensively reflect students' abilities.

### Next Steps
- Summarize the above information and send an email to our mentor therefore ask questions to our client (Hao Guan).
- Start thinking about persona and user stories. (All members)
- Two personas to be built by each subteam and due by Next Monday 23:59. (All members)
