### Discussion Points

1. **Sprint 2 problem review**
    - Unreasonable Role Allocation:
      In previous task allocations, the roles of Scrum master and product owner were assigned within the same subgroup. The mentor also pointed out this issue.
    - Lack of Communication in Task Allocation:
      Some group members believe that the previous method of task allocation lacked communication, which hindered cooperation and clarity of task responsibilities, leading to a decline in overall quality.
    - Lack of Member Engagement:
      In response to the previously mentioned task allocation method, some members suggested that all group members should increase their engagement and proactively seek tasks from the scrum master.
    - Chaotic Trello Updates:
      Due to the lack of a unified standard for updating Trello, everyone added their completed tasks chaotically, resulting in a lack of communication and verification.

2. **Solution to problem**
    - Revised Workflow and Role Assignments:
      Starting from Sprint 3, Mingchong Li will serve as the Scrum Master, and Hao Guan will be the Product Owner.
    - Task Generation at Sprint Start:
      At the beginning of each sprint, we will hold a focused discussion to analyze the project and generate all possible tasks.
    - Task Detailing and Assignment:
      The Scrum Master will write detailed task descriptions and conduct meetings to assign tasks.
