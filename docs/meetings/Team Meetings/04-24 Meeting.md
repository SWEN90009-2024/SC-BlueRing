## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By
- Haocheng Wang

### Discussion Points

1. **Prototype Design**
    - The Prototype needs to at least addresses 4 user story/scenarios  
    - 4 chosen scenarios would be send to Richard after the meeting
    - We don't need to create prototypes for each scenarios, but rather one prototype that satisfies all scenarios.
    - Prototype need to be in a hand-draw style, as preferred by the mentor and client.
    
2. **User Story/Scenarios**
    - 3 high-priority user stories - E1.2, E1.6, and E1.11 - are chosen to be included in the prototype
    - Another new user story is developed based on E1.12 for the system curriculum leader
    - A chart or graph showing the overall performance of all students in class will be easier for teachers to review and provide additional information.

### Action items
- Review and finalise the user stories from sprint2
- Decided stories to be presented to Richard for validation

### Next Steps
- Send email to Richard(RUBY developer) to validate the chosen scenarios
- Start drafting the Prototype based on scenarios
