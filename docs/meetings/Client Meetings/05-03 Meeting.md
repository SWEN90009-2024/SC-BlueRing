## Meeting Summary

### Notes Compiled By
- Haocheng Wang

### Meeting activities

1. **Brief introduction of the project and prototype**
    - A brief introduction of the project background information and the low-fidelity prototype was explained to the client.
    - 5 scenarios included in the prototype were shown and clarified.

2. **Testing section**
    - With all hint options from Figma disabled, the client was kindly asked to test the prototype against 5 scenarios. 

3. **Feedback section**
    - Give additional explanations to help client better understand the intentions of our design.
    - Client provides feedback and comments on the experience of testing our prototypes.
    - Client reviews updated user stories and gives feedback for the improvements or modifications required.

4. **Presentation of the other team**
    - The other team doing the same project also presented their low-fidelity prototype to the client and received feedback.

### Client's Feedback
- Some designs shown in the prototype need to be refined as those might seem odd to users: 
    1. No need to create a Matrix table entry portal on a single student.
    2. Previous page returning functionality is not working properly.
    3. Need improvements on the ordering of instructions pages.
    4. The creation of "group" should be changed to the creation of "class".
    5. Video tutorial is not preferred, should use other forms such as text-written.
    6. Visualisation of data is well done.
    7. Not all buttons shown are clickable.
    8. Having students' names directly shown under different levels instead of only showing while hovering might be better.
    9. There is an overlapping problem for some information shown.
    10. The overall design of prototype components and UI need to be redesigned to avoid confusion.
- Reconsideration of user stories' priority:
    1. E1.2: receive accurate reports -> Must Have.
    2. E1.3: have access to report about student's mental health -> Won't have for this stage.
    3. E1.7: parent viewing report -> Could have, but not yet implemented(The platform is mainly for teachers).
    4. E1.4: academic report -> Won't have, RUBY is focusing on general abilities.
    5. E1.9: Student receive recommendations -> Could have but not for now.
    6. E1.13: prioritization -> Need to focus on the confidence level(reliability), Must Have.
    7. E2.5: Security -> Should have, but out of this project's scope, not our concern.
    8. E2.6: Visualisation -> Must Have.

### Next Steps
- Improve the low-fidelity prototype based on the client's feedback                             (Estimated finish date: Mostly done by 03/05, before 17:00)
- Change the priorities of the current user stories                                             (Estimated finish date: 03/05, before 17:00)
- Start considering about the transition from low->high fidelity prototype                      (Estimated finish date: Between now -> early Sprint4)
- Editing the video recorded of the client testing prototype                                    (Estimated finish date: 03/05, before 17:00)  
- Redesign the weighting system to focus more on the teachers' confidence level instead         (Estimated finish date: Between now -> early Sprint4)
- Import all the files (prototype, video, notes, etc.) to be ready for submission               (Estimated finish date: 03/05, before 17:00)
