## Meeting Summary

---

### Notes Compiled By

- Jianqiao Song

### **Opening of the meeting**

1. Obtain the client’s permission for AI live notes and meeting recordings.

### **Ruby system guidance and practical operation**

1. Richard Xu provided guidance on the use of the ruby system. Hao Guan followed the guidance to complete the creation of the student and finally obtained the student's evaluation report by answering 18 questions.

### **Ideas waiting for client feedback**

1. Hover the mouse over an option to display the standards and examples corresponding to the option / see the evaluations of other teachers
    - Teachers may not like browsing and slow pace
    - There may not be many teachers assessing the same student
    - The client believes that letting teachers influence each other should be avoided, which may lead to bias.
2. Re-assign scores based on each teacher’s ranking of all students
    - The client thought it was an interesting idea
    - We can think carefully about how to calculate the coefficient, such as the time each teacher spends with students
3. Has the Ruby platform been completed? Which part does the client want us to modify or redesign?
    - More in the research stage, any part can be changed, depending on the time
    - Our solution doesn’t even need to be a Ruby plugin, it can be more creative
4. Confirm whether the stakeholders are correct
    - Correct, system security leaders, the school leader, teachers, students and parents

### **Questions that need to be confirmed**

1. Issues of fairness and accuracy
    - For students, assessments of students’ collaboration or critical thinking skills can be provided to help them demonstrate capabilities to universities or future employers.
    - Current challenges: Equity issues (whether different universities are evaluating students in a fair way)
    - Teachers use different criteria when judging ability levels
2. Although generic competencies are assessed, are there significant differences in judgment across disciplines or contexts?
    - The current solution is to assume that judgments are the same in different disciplines and situations, but obviously this assumption is not accurate.
    - One possible solution is to collect more information and add some materials without increasing the workload of teachers too much.
3. What expectations do customers have for consistency and accuracy with high-stakes certificate issuance?
    - As a supplement to the ATAR, it is very high risk and therefore must be trustworthy
4. Are there specific quality standards or evaluation metrics that customers expect your platform to meet?
    - There are not many expectations at the moment, the project is a research prototype, and they will only be randomly applied to 10% of teachers to monitor their performance
5. Do stakeholders have any concerns about data confidentiality and security?
    - This is something that customers need to worry about, we don’t need to worry about it.
    - A high degree of security and confidentiality is indeed required.
6. Reported visibility issues
    - Should students be able to see each other’s reports?
        1. Generally speaking, teachers will not show other people’s reports to students.
        2. But if it is a low-stakes in-class self-assessment report, students may see each other’s reports
        3. For ATAR, students will not see each other’s reports unless they actively disclose them.
    - Are parents and researchers visible?
        1. It depends on the school, different schools have different reporting sharing standards
        2. The client does not encourage schools to print out the report for parents to read because the report is designed for teachers
