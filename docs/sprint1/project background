### Project Overview: Student Competency Assessment Platform (SCAP)

The Student Competency Assessment Platform (SCAP) is developed to address the critical need for accurately measuring and understanding student competencies across a variety of educational settings. This platform enables educators to assess student capabilities in complex areas such as critical thinking and collaboration, utilizing the Ruby programming language for assessment creation and analysis. Through SCAP, teachers submit evaluations based on predefined criteria, resulting in detailed reports on individual learning progression, class-wide performance, and additional insights essential for educational development.

As we embark on the transition towards high-stakes credentialing, SCAP's role becomes increasingly pivotal. The platform's design is aimed at ensuring consistency in the evaluation process, particularly as the implications of credential accuracy grow. One of the main challenges lies in guaranteeing that educators across different subjects and contexts share a uniform understanding of the assessment criteria, ensuring the credentials awarded reflect a true measure of student competency.
