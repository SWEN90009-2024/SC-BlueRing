### Project Overview: Student Competency Assessment Solution (SCAS)

The educational sector increasingly recognizes the importance of accurately assessing students' complex competencies, such as critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork abilities. These competencies are pivotal for not only academic success but also for preparing students for the challenges of the modern workforce. Despite the widespread adoption of various assessment tools, educators continue to face significant challenges in effectively evaluating these competencies. The Ruby platform, while extensively utilized for educational assessments, reveals limitations in assessment consistency, educator workload, and the precision and efficiency of evaluations.

### Problem Statement

Educators employing the Ruby platform for student assessments encounter substantial difficulties, including the considerable workload associated with manual assessment processes and the lack of uniformity in evaluation standards across different educational settings. These issues compromise the reliability of the assessment outcomes and burden the educators, potentially detracting from the teaching and learning experience.

### Solution Scope

This project aims to address these critical challenges by developing innovative solutions that enhance the Ruby platform's functionality. Our objectives include:

- **Improving Assessment Consistency**: Establishing a set of uniform assessment standards and methodologies to ensure consistent evaluation outcomes.
- **Reducing Educator Workload**: Introducing user-friendly tools and automating the assessment processes to alleviate the manual workload on educators.
- **Enhancing Efficiency and Accuracy**: Incorporating advanced data analytics to optimize the assessment process and improve the accuracy of the evaluation results.
