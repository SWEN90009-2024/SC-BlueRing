stakeholders, gather feedback, and collaboratively plan next steps.

## Sprint1 Review

### Participants

Product Owner: Hao Guan
Scrum Master: Tori Li
Development Team: Jianqiao Song, Mingchong Li, Heng CHEN, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Aoxiang Xiao

### Agenda
1. **Project Concept and Background:**: The project concept and background were effectively communicated, providing a clear understanding of the initiative. However, the problem statement lacked clarity within the project background, making it difficult to discern the core issue being addressed. It's essential to clearly articulate the problem, the need for a solution, and outline the proposed solution in 3 to 4 lines for better comprehension.
3. **Target Audience Identification:**: While the target audience was identified, further specificity would enhance the project's focus and alignment with stakeholders' needs.
4. **Project Scope**: The project scope was well-defined, offering a comprehensive overview of the intended deliverables and objectives.
5. **Project Elicitation and Requirements**: The structure of the project elicitation was commendable, effectively addressing project issues, goals, and challenges. The team demonstrated thorough preparation for the client interview, clearly defining roles and responsibilities. However, roles and responsibilities could be further refined for clarity and conciseness.
6. **Task Tracking and Meetings**: More meetings should be documented, including mentor meetings, to ensure comprehensive progress tracking. Tasks discussed in meetings should have clear assignees, due dates, and be consistently tracked to facilitate accountability and progress monitoring.

### Key Outcomes
1. **Clear Problem Statement**: The project now features a clearly defined problem statement within the background, succinctly outlining the issue, the need for a solution, and the proposed approach in 3 to 4 lines, enhancing understanding and alignment with project goals.
2. **Enhanced Target Audience Identification**: The target audience has been further specified, ensuring a more precise focus on stakeholders' needs and facilitating tailored solutions to meet their requirements effectively.
3. **Improved Project Documentation**: The project scope has been refined, providing a comprehensive yet concise overview of deliverables and objectives, aiding in better project planning and management.
4. **Thorough Requirements Gathering**: Project elicitation and requirements gathering have been strengthened, with a clear structure addressing project issues, goals, and challenges, enabling a more robust understanding of project requirements and objectives.
5. **Streamlined Meeting Processes**: Meeting documentation has been enhanced, with diligent recording of meeting notes and proactive efforts to seek client consent, ensuring transparent communication and accountability throughout the project.
6. **Enhanced GitHub Repository**: The GitHub repository has been restructured for improved organization, facilitating effective collaboration and documentation. The README file now prominently displays team members, stakeholders, a changelog for each sprint, and a roadmap for upcoming releases, enhancing project visibility and transparency.
7. **Improved Task Tracking**: Tasks discussed in meetings now have clear assignees, due dates, and are consistently tracked, promoting accountability and progress monitoring to ensure timely project delivery.
8. **Comprehensive Progress Tracking**: More meetings, including mentor meetings, are now documented, enabling comprehensive progress tracking and ensuring alignment with project objectives and timelines.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the feedback received and the subsequent improvements implemented in Sprint 1 have significantly enhanced the project's trajectory 
and potential for success. By addressing areas such as the clarity of the problem statement, the specificity of target audience 
identification, and the refinement of project documentation, we have laid a strong foundation for future iterations. Thorough 
requirements gathering, streamlined meeting processes, and enhanced GitHub repository organization have fostered transparency, 
accountability, and effective collaboration within the team and with stakeholders. Improved task tracking and comprehensive progress
monitoring ensure that we remain on track to deliver results aligned with project objectives and timelines. As we continue to embrace a
culture of continuous improvement, we are confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality solution that meets the needs of our stakeholders
and drives tangible value. With each sprint, we strive to build upon our successes and further refine our approach, ultimately achieving project success 
and exceeding expectations.
