# Sprint Review

The Sprint Review provides an opportunity for our team to demonstrate the work increment completed during the sprint to stakeholders, gather feedback, and collaboratively plan next steps.

## Sprint 2 Review

### Participants

- **Product Owner:** Hao Guan
- **Scrum Master:** Tori Li
- **Development Team:** Jianqiao Song, Mingchong Li, Heng Chen, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Aoxiang Xiao

### Agenda
1. **Project Concept and Background**: We revisited the project’s basic concept, focusing on the use of the Ruby system as discussed with Richard Xu. The team showcased how they implemented the guidance to create a student profile and generate an evaluation report by answering 18 specific questions, which highlighted the system’s practical operations.
2. **Feedback and Adjustments Based on Client Interaction**:
   - **Hovering Feature**: Discussed client feedback on the idea of hovering over an option to display standards and examples, which was met with concerns about potential biases and the slow pace it might introduce.
   - **Score Reassignment Concept**: Presented the idea of reassigning scores based on each teacher’s ranking of students, which the client found interesting. Discussed possible methods for calculating coefficients, such as the duration each teacher spends with students.
   - **System Redesign Freedom**: Confirmed with the client that the Ruby platform is still in the research phase and open to creative redesigns, not necessarily as a Ruby plugin.
3. **Project Scope and Stakeholder Confirmation**: Clarified the stakeholders involved are correct as per the client’s confirmation, encompassing system security leaders, school leaders, teachers, students, and parents. This helps in tailoring the project scope specifically to the needs and security requirements expressed.
4. **Questions and Concerns Addressed**:
   - Discussed fairness and accuracy in assessments, particularly how these assessments could benefit students in demonstrating capabilities to universities or future employers.
   - Explored challenges in ensuring equity across different universities' evaluations and how teachers' varying criteria can impact assessments.
   - Addressed the client’s expectations for consistency and accuracy for high-stakes certificate issuance, highlighting the project’s role as a supplement to the ATAR and its need to be trustworthy.
   - Touched upon data confidentiality concerns and the visibility issues related to report sharing among students, parents, and researchers.

### Key Outcomes
1. **Enhanced Understanding of System Use**: Demonstrated practical application of the Ruby system, directly addressing the client’s guidance and enhancing the team's familiarity with its operations.
2. **Feedback Integration**: Integrated specific client feedback into project development, especially concerning system functionality and user interaction, ensuring that the redesigns align with actual user needs and client concerns.
3. **Scope and Stakeholder Validation**: Validation of the project's stakeholders and scope has led to a more focused approach, ensuring all efforts are directed appropriately and align with confirmed security and privacy requirements.
4. **Addressed Client Concerns**: Proactively addressed the complexities of fairness, accuracy, and security as raised by the client, ensuring that these critical elements are at the forefront of the project development process.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, Sprint 2 has seen significant strides in aligning the project closer to the client’s needs and expectations. By focusing on specific feedback regarding the Ruby system’s functionality and the broader educational context, we have refined our approach to meet the practical realities and challenges identified. Our engagement with the client’s concerns about fairness, accuracy, and security has strengthened the project's framework, setting a solid foundation for future development and implementation. As we progress, our commitment to continuous improvement and responsiveness to stakeholder feedback remains key to achieving a high-quality solution that effectively addresses the needs of all parties involved.
