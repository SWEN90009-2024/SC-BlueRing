# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## Participants

- **Product Owner**: Hao Guan
- **Scrum Master**: Mingchong Li
- **Development Team**: Jianqiao Song, Heng Chen, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Tori Li, Aoxiang Xiao

## Agenda and Key Outcomes

1. **Review of Practices and Outcomes**: 
   - **Prototype Design**:
      - A complete low-fidelity prototype is being produced with scenarios being tested by the client during the usability test
      - Some current prototype designs seem odd according to the client's feedback, improvement required
   - **Team Structure Changes**:
      - Changes have been made to the assignment and management of team positions to improve the efficiency of task assignment and communication
      - Once again, the problem of communication within the team was emphasized and basically solved, but continuous observation and improvement were still necessary
   - **User Story Improvement**
      - User stories updated based on client's feedback
      - Used the MoSCow method for priorities instead of the PERT method

2. **Discussion of Challenges**:
   - **Prototype Refinement**
      - Low fidelity prototype needs further refinement before we transfer it into a high-fidelity prototype according to the client's feedback
   - **Team Working Efficiency**
      - The team lacks a unified workspace where all team members can have access to the most up-to-date ongoing works
   - **Client Communication**
      - The usability test meeting with the client was scheduled on the due date, resulting in very stressful tasks in managing & completing

4. **Proposal of Solutions**: 
   - Actively communicate with the client for the rest of the semester to ensure meetings can be scheduled at an earlier stage
   - Continuously checks client's feedback and changes the design of prototype(both low and high) to keep everything on the right track
   - Further improve the communications among team members to increase the efficiency

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Sprint 3 has brought both success and challenges for our team, a low-fidelity prototype was successfully designed to meet most of the client's expectations while addressing 5 chosen scenarios, together with the direction of the future improvement being set based on valuable feedback from the client during usability testing. The teamwork efficiency was also been improved significantly under all members' efforts: adjustments were made to optimize task assignment and communication, but ongoing vigilance and refinement are still necessary. However, there are still areas for improvement not completed yet, particularly in further low-fidelity prototype design, challenges such as accessibility and readability of the prototype that were acknowledged by the client are also waiting to be solved, and the communication between the team and client also requires enhancement for later sprints. For the rest of the semester, we commit to building a better relationship with the client, continuous our prototype iteration from low to high, and further improving team communication to ensure the success of future sprints.
