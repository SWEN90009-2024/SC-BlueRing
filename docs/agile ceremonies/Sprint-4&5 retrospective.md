# Sprint 4&5 Retrospective

## Participants

- **Product Owner**: Hao Guan
- **Scrum Master**: Mingchong Li
- **Development Team**: Jianqiao Song, Heng Chen, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Tori Li, Aoxiang Xiao

## Agenda and Key Outcomes

1. **Review of Practices and Outcomes**: 
   - **Prototype Design**:
      - A complete high-fidelity prototype is being produced with scenarios being tested by the client during the usability test.
      - Client emphasized the reliability of the data created from the confidence level quiz.
      - Client highlighted the tutorial improvements, such as providing verbal hints to help students focus.

   - **Things to Think About or Improve**
      - Use AI-generated images to enhance educational assessments, but need to think about the problems they bring, such as the possibility that they may contain misleading or offensive content.
      - Avoid video tutorials and use text-based instructions.
      - Need feedback from teachers and students to create a more effective system.
      - The importance of clear explanations and aptitude tests needs to be stressed.

2. **Discussion of Challenges**:
   - **Prototype Refinement**
      - We need to continue tweaking high-fidelity prototypes with a particular focus on data reliability for confidence level quizzes, improving tutorial features, providing verbal prompts to help students focus, and using AI-generated images with caution to avoid potentially offensive content.
   - **Team Workload**
      - Near the end of the project, all documents and artifacts need to be carefully sorted out. This process needs to be carried out very carefully to avoid omissions and minor errors and can take a lot of time. The task is very important.

3. **Proposal of Solutions**: 
   - Think based on client feedback and improve the high-fidelity model.
   - Carry out careful division of labor to avoid missing remaining work while reducing the workload of each team member.

## Conclusion

All in all, Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 brought both success and challenges to our team. A high-fidelity prototype was successfully completed, meeting most of the customer's expectations. After customer testing, the customer was quite satisfied, but there are still some issues to be solved, such as the use of AI-generated images. With the joint efforts of all the team members, we managed to maintain the efficiency of the team members in the last Sprint, and the communication problems were well solved. For the rest of the semester, we worked on organizing all the documentation and giving it a clear structure to better inform our clients about our product and how to use it to ensure that the whole project would be completed well.
