# Sprint 3 Review

## Participants

- **Product Owner**: Hao Guan
- **Scrum Master**: Mingchong Li
- **Development Team**: Jianqiao Song, Heng Chen, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Aoxiang Xiao, Tori Li

## Agenda

1. **Low Fidelity Prototype**:
   - A low-fidelity prototype addressing at least 4 scenarios/user stories with high priority: User Guidance, Importance Quiz, Group Information, Data Visualization, More Information
   - All buttons & options shown in the prototype were made clickable under the relevant scenario environment. 
   - **Action**: Based on the feedback received from the usability test, the design of this prototype needs to be improved on instructions and UI to increase clarity and avoid confusion

2. **User story/task scenarios**
   - The previous PERT method used for user story priorities can create confusion for readers, now prioritized using the method MoSCoW
   - New user stories were created or updated according to the client's feedback and the need for prototype scenarios
   - User stories are being validated by the client and the developer team again to ensure they meet the requirements of this project.
   - **Action**: Continuously update user story based on client & tutor comments and team research

3. **Usability Test**:
   - The low-fidelity prototype was introduced by the team during the client meeting and then tested by the client against 5 scenarios addressed.
   - Usability test done by the client with no hints and only limited/necessary clarification(response to client asks)

4. **Client Feedback and notes**:
   - The weighting system is not too relevant to the functionality of the RUBY platform but the exploration of the confidence level can be further discussed: How do teachers have different criteria or confidence levels accessing students’ general skills, based on their teaching areas
   - Some designs of the prototype seem odd, for example: why does a teacher need to click on a single student to be able to access a group of students?
   - The client has commented that the current solution provided is more focused on user experiences, increasing the reliability of RUBY by helping teachers better understand the accessing process.
   - Some of the user stories need to be modified to fit in the scope of the project
   - **Action**: Summaries and fix problems identified from feedback received - prototype and scenarios need to be modified and prepared for the high-fidelity prototype.

5. **Team Structure**
   - The roles of PO and SM were reassigned to enhance the communication between two sub-team

## Key Outcomes

1. **Improved User Story priority**:
   - User Stories' priorities are now categorized into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves instead of abstract PERT scores.

2. **Clarified project scope**
   - Had a better understanding of the project scope: what is essentially important and what is unrelated to the project.

3. **Improved Team Structure**:
   - Better task assignment and communication among team members 

4. **Smoother Future Transition**:
   - The client's suggestion and changes to the current prototype provide a smoother transition for future high-fidelity prototypes

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the team has made significant progress in the exploration of the possible solution to increase the reliability of the RUBY platform during Sprint 3. The creation and refining of the low-fidelity prototype were being actively engaged with the new prioritization method MoSCoW used for user stories, and the final version of the low-fidelity prototype was tested by the client along with valuable feedback received. Through those processes, the team not only improved the clarity of project scope and the overall understanding of the project goals but also enhanced/optimized team structure for better communication and task allocation. Those insights gained from the client during the usability test will inform the iteration of the prototype towards a high-fidelity version, ensuring a smoother transition and ultimately enhancing the reliability and user experience of the RUBY platform.
