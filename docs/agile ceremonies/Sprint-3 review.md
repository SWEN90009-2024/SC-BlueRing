# Sprint 3 Review

## Participants

- **Product Owner**: Hao Guan
- **Scrum Master**: Mingchong Li
- **Development Team**: Jianqiao Song, Heng Chen, Yutian Fan, Danning Feng, Weihuang Wu, Haocheng Wang, Aoxiang Xiao, Tori Li

## Agenda

1. **Low Fidelity Prototype**:
   - Presented a low-fidelity prototype addressing four high-priority scenarios/user stories: User Guidance, Importance Quiz, Group Information, and Data Visualization.
   - Ensured all buttons and options were clickable within relevant scenario contexts.
   - **Action**: Improve the prototype's instructions and UI based on usability test feedback to enhance clarity and reduce confusion.

2. **User Story/Task Scenarios**:
   - Transitioned from using the PERT method to the MoSCoW method for prioritizing user stories to reduce confusion.
   - Updated user stories based on client feedback and requirements of the prototype scenarios.
   - **Action**: Continuously refine user stories based on feedback from clients, tutors, and ongoing team research.

3. **Usability Test**:
   - Conducted a usability test of the low-fidelity prototype during a client meeting, covering five specific scenarios.
   - Performed the test with minimal guidance, providing only necessary clarifications as requested by the client.

4. **Client Feedback and Notes**:
   - Discussed the relevance of a weighting system to the RUBY platform’s functionality and the possibility of further exploring teacher confidence levels.
   - Addressed specific design concerns, such as the impracticality of accessing group information through individual student profiles.
   - Emphasized that current solutions focus on enhancing user experience to improve RUBY’s reliability.
   - **Action**: Address and resolve issues identified from client feedback; prepare for the development of a high-fidelity prototype.

5. **Team Structure**:
   - Adjusted roles of Product Owner and Scrum Master to improve communication between the two sub-teams.

## Key Outcomes

1. **Enhanced User Story Prioritization**:
   - Replaced abstract PERT scores with MoSCoW categories (must-have, should-have, could-have, won’t-have) for clearer prioritization.

2. **Clarified Project Scope**:
   - Gained a better understanding of the essential aspects of the project and what is outside its scope.

3. **Improved Team Structure**:
   - Enhanced task assignment and communication within the team.

4. **Smoother Future Transition**:
   - Integrated client suggestions into the current prototype to facilitate a seamless transition to future high-fidelity prototypes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Sprint 3 has significantly advanced the RUBY platform's reliability through the development and refinement of the low-fidelity prototype. The adaptation of the MoSCoW method for user story prioritization and the feedback received from the client have sharpened the project's focus. Improved team dynamics and structured feedback processes have optimized both communication and project alignment with client expectations. These developments ensure a smooth progression towards a high-fidelity prototype, ultimately enhancing the platform’s usability and reliability.
