# Project Overview

The Student Competency Assessment Platform (SCAP) is designed to assess complex student skills across various educational settings. Using Ruby, educators can evaluate students' abilities, resulting in individual and class-wide competency reports. This platform serves teachers and administrators by providing detailed insights into students' learning progression, especially as we navigate towards high-stakes certification. Our target audience includes educators, academic institutions, and students, aiming to ensure the accuracy and reliability of educational assessments and credentials.

## Repository Structure

Below is a detailed outline of the repository's structure, providing a clear overview of the organization of documents, tests, prototypes, UI assets, and data samples.

- `docs/` - Contains all documentation files related to the project. Documentation is organized into subfolders for better structuring and ease of access.

- `tests/` - Houses user and system tests that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the SCAP.

- `prototypes/` - This directory is split into two subfolders to differentiate between the stages of prototyping:
  - `low fidelity/` - Includes low-fidelity prototypes such as initial sketches, wireframes, and basic mockups.
  - `high fidelity/` - Contains high-fidelity prototypes, including detailed screens and source files that closely resemble the final product.

- `ui/` - Stores all graphical elements used in the prototypes, including icons, fonts, backgrounds, and other UI components. These assets are crucial for the design phase of the SCAP.

- `data samples/` - Provides documents and data necessary to simulate or demonstrate the prototype, encompassing all inputs required for effective testing and presentation.

- `README.md` - Offers an up-to-date overview of the project repository, including its structure and the contents of each directory. The README file is essential for new contributors, providing them with all the information needed to understand and participate in the project effectively.
