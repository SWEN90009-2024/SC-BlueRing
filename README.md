# Project Overview

The Student Competency Assessment Solution (SCAS) is specifically developed to enhance the assessment of complex student skills in diverse educational settings. Leveraging the capabilities of the existing Ruby platform, this solution is designed to enable educators to more effectively evaluate student abilities, resulting in both individual and aggregated class-wide competency reports. This initiative is primarily aimed at teachers and administrators, offering in-depth insights into the learning progression of students as the educational landscape progresses towards high-stakes certification processes.

Our primary goal is to cater to the needs of educators, academic institutions, and students by promoting the accuracy and reliability of educational assessments and credentials. By addressing key challenges such as the need for assessment consistency, the reduction of teacher workload, and the enhancement of the efficiency and accuracy of evaluations, SCAS seeks to empower stakeholders within the educational ecosystem.

Target Audience: Our solutions are designed with educators, academic institutions, and students in mind, focusing on the pivotal need to support educational excellence through reliable and insightful assessment methodologies.

## Repository Structure

Below is a detailed outline of the repository's structure, providing a clear overview of the organization of documents, tests, prototypes, UI assets, and data samples.

- `docs/` - Contains all documentation files related to the project. Documentation is organized into subfolders for better structuring and ease of access.
- `docs/meetings` - Contains the client and team meeting recording.
- `docs/sprint1` - Contains the documents required in Sprint1 Checklist.

- `tests/` - Houses user and system tests that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the SCAP.

- `prototypes/` - This directory is split into two subfolders to differentiate between the stages of prototyping:
  - `low fidelity/` - Includes low-fidelity prototypes such as initial sketches, wireframes, and basic mockups.
  - `high fidelity/` - Contains high-fidelity prototypes, including detailed screens and source files that closely resemble the final product.

- `ui/` - Stores all graphical elements used in the prototypes, including icons, fonts, backgrounds, and other UI components. These assets are crucial for the design phase of the SCAP.

- `data samples/` - Provides documents and data necessary to simulate or demonstrate the prototype, encompassing all inputs required for effective testing and presentation.

- `README.md` - Offers an up-to-date overview of the project repository, including its structure and the contents of each directory. The README file is essential for new contributors, providing them with all the information needed to understand and participate in the project effectively.
